today we are going to learn how to apply different machine learning methods, begining with clustering: 

The goal here is to find groups/clusters in your input data.

Firt I will make up some data with clear groups. For this I will use the `rnorm()` function.
```{r}
rnorm(10)
```


```{r}
hist(rnorm(1000, mean=3))
```

```{r}
n <- 30
x <- c(rnorm(n, -3), rnorm(n,+3))
y <- rev(x)

z <- cbind(x,y)
head(z)
```

```{r}
plot(z)
```


Use the `kmeans()` function setting k to 2 and nstart=20

Inspect/print the results 

>Q. How many points are in each cluster?

>Q. What 'component' of your result objct details
      - cluster size?
      - cluster assignment/membership?
      - cluster center? 
      
>Q. Plot z colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and add cluster centers as blue points


```{r}
km <- kmeans(z, centers =2)
km
```


Results in kmeans object `km`
```{r}
attributes(km$centers)
```

cluster size?
```{r}
km$size
```

cluster assignment/membership?
```{r}
km$cluster
```

cluster center?
```{r}
km$center
```

>Q. Plot z colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and add cluster centers as blue points

```{r}
plot(z, col="blue")
```

R will re-cycle the shorter color vector to be the same length as the longer (number of data points) in z
```{r}
plot(z, col=c("red","blue"))
```

```{r}
plot(z, col=3)
```

```{r}
plot(z, col=km$cluster)
```


We can use the `points()` function to add new points to an existing plot... like the cluster centers.

```{r}
plot(z, col=km$cluster)
points(km$centers, col="blue", pch=17, cex=3)
```

> Q. Can you run kmeans and ask for 4 clusters please and plot the results like we have done above?

```{r}
km4 <- kmeans(z, centers =4)
plot(z, col=km4$cluster)
points(km4$centers, col="blue", pch=18, cex=3)

```


## Hierarchical Clustering 

Let's take our same made-up data `z` and see how hclust works.

First we need a distance matrix of our data to be clustered 

```{r}
d <- dist(z)
hc <- hclust(d)
hc
```
```{r}
plot(hc)
abline(h=8, col="red")
```


I can get my cluster membership vector by "cutting the tree" with the `cutree()` function like so: 

```{r}
grps <- cutree(hc, h=8)
grps
```


Can you plot `z` colored by our hclust results:

```{r}
plot(z, col=grps)
```

## PCA of UK food data

Read data from the UK on food consumption in different parts of the UK

```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <- read.csv(url, row.names=1)
head(x,)
```

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=T, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```


A so-called "Pairs" plot cna be useful for small datasets like this one

```{r}
pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)
```

It is hard to see structure and trends in even this small data-set. How will we ever do this when we have a big datasets with 1,000s or 10s of thousands of things we are measuring...

### PCA to the rescue

Let's see how PCA deals with this dataset. So main function in base R to do PCA is called `prcomp()`

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(t(x))
summary(pca)
```


Let's see what is inside this `pca` object that we created from running `prcomp()`

```{r}
attributes(pca)
```


```{r}
pca$x
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=c("black", "red", "blue", "darkgreen"), pch=16,
     xlab="PC1 (67.4%)", ylab="PC2 (29%)")
```

```{r}
par(mar=c(10, 3, 0.35, 0))
barplot( pca$rotation[,1], las=2 )
```
